I have questions. Lots of them. Questions that I keep tossing and turning over in my head. I ponder about actions, repercussions, conflicting ideas, paradigm shifts, paradoxical behaviors, morals, beliefs, emotions. I see people around me being so sure of everything. As if things were black and white, indelible and set in stone. But I have a hard time with absolutes and certainty. I don't believe them. It works for facts but never for emotions, beliefs or behaviours.

There is this whole gamut of the intangible inside our head. We carry it to each and every experience of ours. Our formative experiences frame our early beliefs and opinions. These in turn influence the choices we make on future experiences. And then the cycle repeats. Usually we operate with the notion that our perspective is the whole truth. But is our perspective based on current, updated beliefs and truths? How do we make sure we do not let arbitrary experiences mandate our construct of the world?

This blog is my attempt to ask questions and follow those up with helpful clues and maybe answers too. I welcome ideas that contradict my current understanding. I love criticism because it challenges my perspective. I am open to tossing out my beliefs if new ones, validated thoroughly, make more sense. Just like everyone out there, I am trying to better understand the puzzle that we are. 

**I hope what you read here makes you pause, think and ask questions of your own.**
